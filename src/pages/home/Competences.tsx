        While I mostly work on Web Applications, I also have experience with
        React Native or Electron to create native Applications. Additionally, I
        have 2 years of experience with Swift (and lately, SwiftUI) and the
        development of native iOS applications. I have worked with both NoSQL
        and SQL databases and also have experience with building real-time
        applications using sockets. I have quite some experience regarding UI /
        UX design and use Design-Tools such as InVision or Figma to create
        Prototypes for private projects myself. While I am not a fully educated
        designer, I think of myself as someone who has an eye for good design
        and I value it highly. Additionally, I have experience with deploying
        applications on self-hosted clusters, as I am running my own server
        where I have deployed several applications over the course of years.
        Last but not least, I have experience with a multitude of different
        packages in the JavaScript ecosystem and know solutions for many complex
        problems, both in the backend and the frontend.
